# Functions

Functions are Komodo values. You can pass other values to them (the input), and they are going to return another value that depends on these values (the output).

Functions are the main characters of Komodo: They are the main tool to describe routines and reuse them.

There are two ways of describing functions: [named functions](./functions/named_functions.md) and [anonymous functions](./functions/anonymous_functions.md). But first, we'll look at some (named functions) that come pre-implemented and included when you write a Komodo program: the [builtin functions](./functions/builtin_functions.md).
