# Introduction

**Symstatic** is a programming language to test ideas in a fast and easy way. It is ideal for problems with basic discrete structures, like numbers and words. Symstatic tries to make operating with these entities as easy as possible while minimizing the amount of code needed to achieve a successful implementation. Symstatic is a scripting language regarding its flexibility, but it is a pretty specific language with a lot of assumptions about how things should be. Symstatic is an experimental language, and some of its features are there because I had a personal preference for them.

Symstatic draws inspiration from [Picat](https://picat-lang.org/), [SETL](https://setl.org/setl/) and the [Wolfram Language](https://www.wolfram.com/language/) (I blame my university homework for the last one). It definitely has influence from (wait for it) Python and JavaScript, which are languages that I used for several years before learning more programming paradigms. Symstatic is in part a result of my frustrations with these languages.

Symstatic is unstable (I just add what I want) and in active development. Here is the [source code](https://github.com/danilopedraza/symstatic).

This document is a guide to show how to use Symstatic.
