# VSCode Extension

There is a VSCode extension available for Komodo. Right now, it just adds syntax highlighting. It is published in the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=komodo.komodo-analyzer) and [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/komodo/komodo-analyzer), so you can easily search it in VSCode and VSCodium.
