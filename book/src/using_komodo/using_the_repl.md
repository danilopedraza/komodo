# Using the REPL

To start the REPL, you just have to type `komodo` in the terminal. It will show you something like this:

```
>>> 
```

You can type a Komodo expression, and it will evaluate it. Let's try something simple:

```
>>> "Hello, world!"
"Hello, world!"
```

You can do arithmetic:

```
>>> 2 + 2
4
```

You can store values with a `let` expression:

```
>>> let a := 1 + 0.5
1.5
>>> a + 0.5
2.0
```
