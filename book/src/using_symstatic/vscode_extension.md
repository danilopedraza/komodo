# VSCode Extension

There is a VSCode extension available for Symstatic. Right now, it just adds syntax highlighting. It is published in the [VS Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=symstatic.symstatic-analyzer) and [OpenVSX](https://open-vsx.org/extension/symstatic/symstatic-analyzer), so you can easily search it in VSCode and VSCodium.
