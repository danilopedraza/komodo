- Mutable values: You can set mutable values with the `var` keyword. Mutation is restricted to the scope of declaration.

- `cons` notation: You can use `[first|rest]` or `{some|rest}` to pass recursively or build new lists or sets, respectively.

- Code blocks: now indentation can be used to specify code blocks.
